It is the closest and last stop on the N,F,Q,D train lines.  One can get from Stillwell Station to the Loft, by making a straight walk on Mermaid Ave or Surf Ave or the Boardwalk. It is about a 10 to 15 min walk. The Boardwalk is the best to stroll through from the station to the Loft. This walk is about 20 min, since the Boardwalk is a little curved. Yet, another way getting around can be by taking the Green Taxis.  They can be seen lined up in front of the Train Station on Mermaid Avenue and are only 2 dollars per person to the Loft.

       "   'comments': 'The place is very nice, clean, and quiet. Looks just like the pictures. Unfortunately, I cannot say my stay was pleasant. The room gets HOT in the summer. It does not have windows, and air conditioning was not installed until June 23rd (I moved in on May 7th). I left the air on overnight because I didn\\'t know I was supposed to turn it off (I\\'ve had central air my whole life, and from my discussions with other people, I don\\'t think turning off a window unit at night is necessarily normal either). When Anna realized I was leaving it on, instead of having a civil adult conversation with me, she screamed at me and insulted me, calling me immature and telling me I didn\\'t have any common sense (because in her opinion turning AC off at night, even when it is 100 degrees outside, is \"common sense\"). After this incident, I turned the AC off and didn\\'t touch it again. Someone else moved in to the other airbnb room she has listed, and started using the AC. This new guest also left it on overnight. Instead of speaking with the new guest, Anna waited for me at the front door until I left for work, and followed me out of the house screaming at me and calling me stupid and immature again. So yes the place is nice, but definitely not worth what I had to deal with. Also, the neighborhood is definitely not the safest, especially for a young woman. '},\n",
